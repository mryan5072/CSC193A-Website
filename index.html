    <p>Graphics technology is an evolving one that most recently started to introduce <strong>Ray Tracing</strong> in real-time graphics. 
        Previously, <strong>Ray Tracing</strong> was only done in pre-rendered animated movies.
        As seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653237/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing">here</a>, the game Cyberpunk 2077 currently has the most
        advanced form of Ray Tracing in a video game at the moment.
